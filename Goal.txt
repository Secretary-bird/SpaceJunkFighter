We realized early on that the snake concept was gonna be too dificult to complete 
with the time we had left, so we decided to make a game with the mechanics of an old game
called Space Harrier. We used the mechanic from apple picker to destroy objects that flew
past the character and force them to lose a life. We also used the rotation functionality 
on the enemy entities so we dont have static objects flying towards us. The OnMouseDown
was what allowed us to fire the lazer to destroy the projectiles, and we destroyed 
projectiles like in apple picker instead of just deactivating them from the game and
allowing instances of the enemy projectile to keep spawning infinitly. It incorperated 
more of what the project was actually about, while also being managable to create.
We ended up having problems with the github process, the gitignore wasn’t working properly.
We were only able to make about two commits.
